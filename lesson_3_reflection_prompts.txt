When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

So you can collaborate with others, as well as have added security in terms of backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may not want to have a change added to your remote repository on your local repository, ie if you're collaborating with others you may want to vet the change first.

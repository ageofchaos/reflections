What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates the git folder, which allows git to make commits on the files inside (aka creates a repository).

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
 What value do you think it offers?

 The staging area is a virtual space. It allows you to add only the files that are related at once.
